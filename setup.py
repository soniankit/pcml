PCML
====

The parallel cartographic modeling language (PCML) is a multi-institutional 
collaborative project aiming to create a computing language for 
cyberGIScientists that is designed for (1) usability, (2) programmability, and 
(3) scalability. PCML provides multi-core parallel processing for spatial 
operations while hiding the implementation complexities of parallelism.
